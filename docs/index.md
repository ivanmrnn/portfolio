I chose to build the website using only **HTML**, **CSS**, and Vanilla **JavaScript** because these foundational languages are at the core of many modern web apps and frameworks. It feels fitting to use them in my web portfolio, which serves as a hub for all my projects and experience across different technologies.

I used **VS Code**, **Figma**, **MkDocs**, and **ReadtheDocs** for their simplicity and ease of use.

**Cloudflare Pages** was used because of its free tier and having better security than Github Pages 

I also integrated Cloudflare Analytics and Google Search console to track human and search traffic.
